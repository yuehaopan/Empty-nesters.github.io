On December 9, 2021, the State Council Information Office held a press conference to introduce the relevant information of the Guidance The Ministry of Civil Affairs Department of Elderly Services said that according to the relevant statistics of the National Association of the Aging, the ratio of empty nest elderly people in the country should be half to half in urban and rural areas. Focus on rural left-behind and empty nest elderly is the work and focus of the elderly service. In general, the care services for the rural left-behind and empty-nest elderly are divided into roughly three levels.
<br />
<br />
First, in the promotion of universal home and community elderly care services, the empty nest elderly in rural areas are the key service groups and service objects, including in the promotion of the elderly table, day care, age-appropriate transformation work, if the empty nest elderly, should be the priority care policy objects. 
<br />
<br />
Second, over the years, the civil affairs system in the process of promoting rural elderly services, combined with the actual rural, characteristics, features, the empty nest elderly services into the focus of elderly services, there are also a lot of innovation and practice, for example, in these years to promote the rural mutual elderly services, is through the younger elderly to take care of the older elderly, and to promote "party building + rural Senior care services", through the role of grass-roots party organizations, cohesion or organization of social resources for the rural elderly, the focus of services also include rural left-behind or empty nest elderly. Since the "13th Five-Year Plan", the civil affairs department has been carrying out the construction of rural social underpinning projects, renovating and improving the service capacity of rural homes for the elderly, which used to be mainly for the special hardship cases, but after renovation and upgrading, they provide services for all the elderly, and also take the empty nest elderly as the key service targets.
<br />
<br />
Third, for the rural left-behind and empty nest elderly, the development of the establishment of a special care service system, the Ministry of Civil Affairs in conjunction with relevant departments to promote the establishment of care services for the rural left-behind elderly system, universal regular visits to the empty nest and left-behind elderly system, whether through volunteers or government purchase of services, or through the village committee of these organizational forces, are regular visits to the left-behind and empty nest elderly, to understand their The system of regular visits to elderly people left behind and empty nesters, whether through volunteers or government purchased services, or through village committees, to understand their needs and difficulties and provide emergency assistance.
<br />
<br />
Generally, there is almost a gap in the policy of aging at home. More than 95% of the elderly people have to age at home. However, due to the miniaturization of families, it is difficult for families to perform the function of aging in place, and government policies for aging in place are needed to support them. Developed countries are paying more and more attention to aging at home, and have formulated a series of tax exemption policies, allowance policies, and flexible employment policies to support aging at home. China has almost no support policies other than the one-child family incentive policy. There is a shortage of human resources for elderly care services. At present, China needs about 10 million elderly care workers, but there are only 300,000 elderly care workers in the country, of which less than 100,000 have obtained professional qualifications. The institutional mechanism of the elderly service industry is not perfect. The development of the lack of unified planning, cross-functional government departments, unclear authority and responsibility, lack of synergy. Government responsibility is not clear enough, and the role of the market mechanism is not enough. Accordingly, support policies for the elderly service industry are not well-performed, and the development of private elderly service institutions is slow. As of the end of 2011, more than 40,000 various types of elderly service institutions, most of which are public institutions, the number of beds in private institutions accounted for only about 1/3 of the total number of beds.
