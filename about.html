	Sometimes we can see news on Chinese news sites that "A man came home from abroad and found his parents living alone had passed away for many days"; "An elderly empty nester died in his own home”…… Such tragedies arouse our attention to the elderly nesters' living conditions. There is an ancient Chinese saying that goes like this, "Therefore people do not only serve their parents, they do not only nurture their children, but also make it possible for the elderly to end their days, for the middle-aged to serve society, and for young children to grow up successfully, so that the old man without a wife, the old man without a husband, the children who lost their fathers when they were young, the old man without children, and the disabled can all be provided for. " But what is the living conditions and mental status of the elderly empty nesters in China? And is there any policy targeting at them? What else need to be done?

            <h3>What is “Empty Nesters”?</h3>
          
<p>
              Empty nesters are elderly people who have no children to take care of them and live alone or in pairs. There are three kinds of cases: one is the widowed elderly who have no children and no companion, another is the elderly who have children but live alone apart from them, and another is the elderly whose children are far away and have no choice but to keep the empty nest.

            <h3>Aging Trend and Empty Nesters in China</h3>
 <div style="text-align:left">
            <p>
              With the deepening of aging in society, the number of empty nesters is increasing and has become a social problem that cannot be ignored. At present, the population <b>aged 60 and above</b> in China has reached <b>264 million</b>. The fourth sample survey on the living conditions of the elderly in urban and rural areas in China shows that the number of <b>empty nesters</b> has exceeded <b>100 million</b>. This marks that China is about to step into a deeply aging society. The China Development Report 2020: Development Trends and Policies for China's Aging Population, released by the China Development Foundation, predicts that the number of people aged 65 and above in China will exceed 210 million in 2025, and the number of people aged 65 and above is expected to reach 380 million by 2050, accounting for nearly 27.9%.

Li Bonghua, deputy director of the Department of Elderly Services of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, said on October 26 2022 that the proportion of empty nest elderly people in China is now more than half, and in some big cities and rural areas, the proportion of empty nest elderly people even exceeds 70%. The number of elderly people living alone in China is growing rapidly. In 2010, the number of elderly people living alone in China was about 17.56 million households, and by 2020 this figure has reached 25.4 million households, and according to the China Family Development Report, the number of elderly households living alone in China is expected to reach 37.22 million by 2030.

    <p>
At present, the "empty nesters" in China are relatively unsatisfied with the current state of their lives, both physically and psychologically, and the manifestations and reasons are as follows.
</br>
</br>
In terms of mental health, the "empty nesters" are alone at home and often feel depressed. The "empty nesters" spend most of their time at home by themselves, because they can't get in touch with new things in society for a long time, they don't know how to use new communication software, and they can't communicate with the outside world for a long time because they are too old and can't go out conveniently. This problem is even more serious for "empty nesters" living in rural areas.
</br>
</br>
The material condition of the empty nesters is not much better due to the poor living environment and low income. The economic source of the "empty nest elderly" is mainly supported by their children, followed by the income from labor, including pensions and part-time jobs, which leads to the lack of rich material life of the "empty nest elderly". Moreover, the "empty nesters" are relatively weak in terms of social knowledge and structure, both physically and intellectually, which makes them unable to obtain more economic income to enrich their daily life, and this is one of the reasons for their physical and psychological problems.
</br>
</br>
However, China's current <b>senior care facilities and services</b> are far from adequate. As we can see from the picture below, beds per 1000 elderly people is about 30 in 2019. Although this number is showing an increasing trend, the number is still inadequate, and the growth rate is still too low. The inadequacy of the social security system reduces the satisfaction of "empty nesters".

<p>
Although the government started trying to help the "empty nesters" financially, it cannot fundamentally solve the problems of the "empty nesters". The lack of help from other social organizations and the inadequacy of social welfare measures do not improve the leisure time of the "empty nesters", which makes the "empty nesters" This makes the "empty nest elderly" not satisfied with the spiritual aspect in their daily life.
